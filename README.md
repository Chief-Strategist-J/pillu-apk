**Notification Integration Documentation**

*Introduction:*
This documentation provides a guide on integrating push notifications into your application using the OneSignal service. Push notifications are a powerful tool for engaging users and keeping them informed about updates, messages, or events.

*Prerequisites:*

Before integrating push notifications, ensure you have the following:

- A valid OneSignal account.
- Your OneSignal App ID.
- Your OneSignal REST API Key.
- The base URL for your application.

*Integration Steps:*

1. **Initialize OneSignal:**
   In your application config file

2. **Configure Notification Settings:**
   Customize notification settings according to your application's requirements. You can control the appearance, sound, and behaviour of notifications through OneSignal's dashboard.

3. **Handling Notifications:**
   Implement logic to handle incoming notifications. OneSignal provides events and callbacks that allow you to execute specific actions when a notification is received or opened.

4. **Testing:**
   Verify the integration by sending a test notification through the OneSignal dashboard or API. Ensure that the notifications are received on the target devices.

5. **Advanced Features:**
